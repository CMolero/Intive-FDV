# Intive-FDV-Project
For this project I decided to create multiple calsses making it easier to scale, separating the specific logic making easy the task of modifying the code. I based this decision in the low complexity of the task, I simply used an abstract class and separate the more specific logic in it's own class, then overrode the "rent" method from his parent.
------------------------------
I used Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 to code the clases and Unit Tests,  the conventions used were many of the basic c# conventions.
